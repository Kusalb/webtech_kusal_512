<p>IT4D (Information Technologies for Development) is an initiative aimed at bridging the digital divide (the disparity between 
technological "have" and "have not" geographic locations or demographic groups) and aiding economic development by ensuring equitable access to up-to-date
 communications technologies. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) include any communication device -- encompassing radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them, such as videoconferencing and distance learning.
